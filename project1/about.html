            The 3D shopping web page project created by students in the CG class
            of the Computer Science course at UFPel is an impressive example of
            using WebGL features to enhance the online shopping experience. The
            project is designed to allow users to explore virtual shops and
            interact with 3D product models.

            The homepage of the website provides a user-friendly interface with
            a search bar, navigation buttons, and categories of products
            available in the virtual stores. The website also includes a login
            page, where users can create their accounts, add products to their
            cart, and make purchases.
          </p>

            The virtual shops are designed with detailed 3D models of the
            stores, displaying shelves and racks stocked with various products.
            The user can click on a product to select it, view it in 3D, and
            even zoom in and out to inspect it further. There are also options
            for adding the item to the cart or wishlist.

            To enhance the user experience, the project includes several WebGL
            features, such as lighting and shadow effects, realistic textures,
            and smooth animations. The 3D models are rendered in real-time,
            making it easy to navigate and explore the virtual shops.

            Overall, this 3D shopping web page project is an excellent example
            of how technology can be used to enhance online shopping
            experiences. The use of WebGL features adds a new level of immersion
            and interactivity, making it an exciting and engaging shopping
            experience for users..
